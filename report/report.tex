            Abstract: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a common NP-Complete problem in
            Computer Science and Optimization. Thus, there is no known way to solve it
            in polynomial time at the time of this writing.
            In this report, we will analyse Genetic algorithm approach to TSP and compare it with
            Brute-Force Search method.

    \section{Introduction}

    \IEEEPARstart{I}{n} this report, we strived to analyze the performance of a genetic algorithm,
    onto Traveling Salesman Problem to find the optimum path to traverse a multi-node undirected and
    weighted graph. On the other side, to measure the pros / cons of the GA approach, we will also apply
    brute-force method on the same problem.

    \section{Problem Definition}

    For this research, we will define the problem as a \textit{undirected graph} with N nodes.
    There are edges with several weights between those nodes. In TSP analogy, the nodes represent
    cities, and edges represent paths between those cities. Edge weights, represent the distances
    between two cities. A route is valid if the salesman start traveling from a given node, visit
    all cities once, and return back to the starting city.

    Since the graph is not necessarily a \textit{complete graph}, the algorithm should check next
    available nodes from the node at a single time to create the route. All nodes should be visited
    once. So we should be aware of the possible circular routes and should avoid them.

    \section{Methods}
    In this paper, we will use two different methods to the same problem.

    \subsection{Brute-Force Search}
    Brute-Force Search solves this problem in an inefficient but a definite way. To find the best
    route, Brute-Force Search checks all possible path permutations without any specific condition
    or restriction. While checking routes, it stores and updates the shortest route from the start
    of the execution. When the checks are finished, the shortest route is the last route stored.
    Since it checks all possible routes, it makes sure that the returned result is the best possible
    solution.

    \subsection{Genetic Algorithm}
    Solving the problem with a Genetic Algorithm is more efficient but indefinite. This is because in
    a GA, we do not necessarily check all possible routes, instead we try to evolve a set of routes to
    create a better route. GA approach is an iterative method which is based on the natural selection
    mechanism of evolution. Since natural selection \textit{-thus evolution} doesn't have a stopping
    point, Genetic Algorithms do not have a strict finishing point. So we presume that there can always
    be a better solution at the any state of the algorithm execution, and will choose a stopping condition.


    \section{Implementation}
    The code \cite{code_repository} of both Brute-Force and Genetic Algorithm approaches are implemented
    in Python. We tried to keep the code simple by removing any nonessential parts. This also helped to
    measure and compare the performances since there are almost no avertible computational cost in any
    implementation.

    \section{Results}

    \section{Conclusion}
    The conclusion goes here.
